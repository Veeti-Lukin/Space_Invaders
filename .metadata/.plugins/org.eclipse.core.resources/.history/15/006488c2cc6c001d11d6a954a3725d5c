//Instructions are conditional
//32-bit instruction


//How to load data from memory:
//LDR R0, =variable 	(Load address to register. You can use any global variable defined in main.c, or variable found here)
//LDR R1, [R0] 			(Load data from address, in this case 32-bit data)
//LDRB R1, [R0] 		(Load data from address, in this case 8-bit data)
//******
//LDR R0, =0x123456		(Load address to register, Use only if you know the memory address)
//LDR R1, [R0]			(load data from address, in this case 32-bit data)
//LDRB R1, [R0]			(load data from address, in this case 8-bit data)

//How to store data to memory:
//STR R1,[R0]			(R1 contains the data and R0 contains the address where  to store, 32-bit)
//STRB R1,[R0]			(R1 contains the data and R0 contains the address where  to store, 8-bit)
