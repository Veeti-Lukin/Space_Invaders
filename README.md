# Space_Invaders
Embedded system project to build a minimalistic version of space invaders game.  Using PYNQ-Z1 microcontroller and xilinx ide

source files are in path: Embedded_Exercise_normal/src

# About
This project was a task made for Comp.ce.100 - Introduction to embedded systems course in Tampere university. Materials in directory: "Exercise_materials" are all the materials given for the task. 

My task was mainly implement the functionality of the "Embedded_Exercise_normal/src/pixel.c" that works as a driver of a led matrix and to code the game logic in  "Embedded_Exercise_normal/src/main.c" that utilizes the driver. Most interesting part of the project was that I coded one of the functions used in "main.c" in ARM assembly and that can be found in "Embedded_Exercise_normal/src/blinker.s".
